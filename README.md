# Space Adventure Game

This is a project that I have been working on for some time

It is a text-based adventure game sort of based on other open-world games.

The idea is that you are a Space Adventurer traveling through space trying to delay the inevitable destruction of the universe.

## How To Play:

### Moving Between Planets
To start play simply select a planet by using the number keys. \
From there you have four options:
1. Mine for Rare Metals
2. Syphon Gases
3. Leave the planet

You can open your inventory at any time when selecting an action or planet.

### Mining & Refining Metals
You will extract metals in their unrefined, low-value, ore form. 
To increase the value of these metals, you can spend a turn refining a specific metal type on Mars. 

### Syphoning Gases
When you decide to syphon gases, you will extract high value gases at a lower rate. 
This type of item does not need to be refined.

### Destruction
Each action you do uses a turn. 
Once your ```turns until destruction``` hits 0, the game will end. 

### Marketplace
If you want to delay this destruction, you can visit the marketplace on Earth. 
Here you can sell the items you've collected for credits.
You can then spend those credits on various items. 

Currently in the game, there are three item types:
1. Strength Items
2. Science Items
3. Refractor Delay

Strength items are items that increase your strength, increasing the number of metals mined.

Science items are the same, increasing your science, which increases how many gases you extract.

Currently, the Refractor Delay is the only way to delay the destruction of the universe. 
This item currently costs 500 credits, and will delay the turns until destruction by 5.
